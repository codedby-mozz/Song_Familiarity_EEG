EEG data were preprocessed using the MNE-Python library (version 1.9.0; Larson et al., 2024) running on Python 3.11.9. Signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 30 Hz and downsampled to 256 Hz. Artifact rejection was performed using independent component analysis (ICA) with the FastICA algorithm. Components corresponding to eye blinks were identified based on activity in the Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes, as no dedicated EOG channels were available.

Events of interest were selected to capture both stimulus-related and response-related neural activity. These included stimulus onset events such as "note onset (familiar)" and "note onset (unfamiliar)", as well as participant response events during the multiple-choice (MC) phase, such as "onset MC (correct)" and "onset MC (incorrect)".

To enable condition-specific ERP analysis, a custom relabelling function was applied. Note-onset events (originally coded as 9) were reclassified based on the participant’s subsequent recognition outcome during the multiple-choice phase. Specifically, each note-onset was relabelled according to the first outcome event that followed it: if the response was 7 (correct), the note-onset was relabelled as 100; if it was 8 (incorrect), it was relabelled as 101.

Although participants made recognition judgments about the entire melody, this relabelling approach allowed for trial-level comparisons of EEG responses to individual notes within melodies that were ultimately recognized correctly versus incorrectly. This enabled examination of whether early neural responses to individual notes differed between familiar and unfamiliar trials—providing insight into how quickly familiarity-related processing emerges in the EEG signal, and how far before conscious recognition these differences can be detected.

Epochs were created time-locked to multiple events of interest—including both stimulus onset and participant responses—spanning from -200 ms to 800 ms relative to event onset. Automatic rejection of bad epochs was applied to exclude trials with excessive noise. Across included participants, between 0% and 44% of epochs were removed during this stage. Data were then re-referenced to the average reference and baseline-corrected using the pre-stimulus interval (-200 to 0 ms).

All preprocessing steps—including filtering, ICA component rejection, and epoching—were visually inspected to ensure data quality and the appropriateness of artifact correction. This allowed for the identification of residual artifacts and confirmation of component selection.
