# EEG Study on Song Familiarity

This repository documents an **independent EEG analysis** project, driven by self-learning, that explores neural responses to familiar vs. unfamiliar melodies.

## üß™ Study Overview

The goal is to investigate potential neural markers of auditory familiarity using EEG event-related potentials (ERPs). Specifically, this analysis is focused on answering these questions:

- What are the EEG correlates of the moment a song becomes familiar?
- How does behavioral recognition (accuracy and response time) relate to ERP components or spectral EEG activity?
- Can we detect neural patterns predictive of correct vs incorrect identification?

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is not an official research project. It is a personal exploration of EEG methods and tools, based on public data.

## üöß Current Progress

- [x] Preprocessed EEG data for a single participant
- [x] Applied artifact rejection (AutoReject)  
- [x] Epoched data around labeled note events  
- [x] Re-referenced and baseline-corrected the data
- [x] Preprocess EEG data for all participants
- [x] Manual inspection of epochs - Preprocessing was largely automated. I manually reviewed each participant's data to identify any remaining bad epochs or problematic channels. If any significant issues are found, I will revisit and adjust the preprocessing steps accordingly.
- [ ] Reassess preprocessing steps - Some channels for certain participants are too noisy or completely "dead". I am currently reviewing and adjusting preprocessing methods to ensure data quality.
- [ ] Group-level ERP analysis 
- [ ] Statistical comparison of conditions
- [ ] Training an AI on EEG data to classify songs as familiar or unfamiliar

## üìå Why I'm Doing This

This project supports my self-guided learning in cognitive neuroscience and EEG analysis, aiming to:

- Deepen understanding of EEG preprocessing pipelines  
- Gain hands-on experience with the MNE-Python  
- Explore neural markers of auditory familiarity
- Improve scientific coding and visualization skills
